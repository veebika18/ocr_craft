# Advanced Text Extraction Application

## Frontend Features
- Document upload interface for PDF, Word, Image and Text files
- Text extraction visualization and editing
- Multiple download formats (PDF, DOC, TXT, Image)
- Information about extraction algorithms and technologies

## Backend Integration Points
The frontend is designed to integrate with a Flask API that would include:

### Text Extraction Algorithms
- Transformer-based OCR (using models like EasyOCR, Tesseract v5)
- CNN-based document analysis
- Pre-processing techniques:
  - Adaptive thresholding
  - Deskewing and rotation correction
  - Noise reduction
  - Image enhancement
- Post-processing techniques:
  - Spell checking
  - Context-aware error correction
  - Format preservation
  - NLP improvements

## How to Use
1. Upload a document (PDF, Word, Image, or Text file)
2. The system processes the document using multiple algorithms
3. View the extracted text
4. Download the text in your preferred format

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Required Backend Implementation
To fully implement this application, you'll need to create a Flask API with:

1. File upload endpoint
2. Text extraction using multiple algorithms
3. Format conversion for downloads
4. Error handling and validation

Example Python packages needed for the backend:
- Flask
- PyTesseract
- EasyOCR
- PyPDF2
- python-docx
- Pillow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
